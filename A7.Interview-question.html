9. What do you mean by dot notation and bracket notation? When should you use dot notation or bracket notation? 
Ans: Dot Notation vs Bracket Notation:
1. Dot notation is faster to write and clearer to read, easy to read
2. Square bracket notation allows access to properties containing special characters and selection of properties using variables.
3. You can use variables with dot notation but not with bracket notation. This is especially useful for situations when you want to access a property but don't know the name of the property ahead of time.
